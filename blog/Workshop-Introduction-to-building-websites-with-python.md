category: python, workshop

On **04-04-2017**, I presented a web development [workshop](https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/44420 "workshop") at my Alma mater, the University of Western Ontario. My goal was to guide the participants through the process of building a simple [cloud storage app](https://github.com/arzeid/simple-cloud "simple cloud"). I hoped to familiarize the attendees with all of the technologies they need to build their own web apps. [The Workshop Slides can be found here](/workshops/introduction%20to%20building%20websites%20with%20python "link to slides").

*The tech stack for the workshop consisted of:*

- ***Python*** - Backend Language
- ***Javascript*** - Frontend Language
- **Pip** - Python package manager
- **Flask** - A micro framework for Python
- **Virtualenv** - A tool to create isolated Python environments
- **Jinja2** - A template engine for Python
- **JQuery** - A Javascript library simplifying Javascript programming
- **dropzoneJS** - A library that provides drag’n’drop file uploads in Javascript.

If you are interested in learning about developing a web app using this tech stack, you can learn more by following the workshop's [slides](/workshops/introduction%20to%20building%20websites%20with%20python "link to slides").
